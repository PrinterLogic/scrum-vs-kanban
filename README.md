# scrum-vs-kanban
This is a test repository.
It is designed to simulate and benchmark the differences between a scrum and a kanban environment.

## Assumptions

### Engineers/Workers
A team will be made up of 5 engineers:
1 Staff Engineer
2 Senior Engineers
1 Mid Level Engineer
1 Junior Engineer
This will be simulating a real team by adding a multiplier to how long an engineer worker will take to do a task.
These are estimates and don't reflect the work of any particular engineers.
Here are the multipliers:
Staff = 1x
Senior = 1.25x
Mid Level = 1.5x
Junior = 2x

### Agile Types
Kanban works by assigning all workers one ticket and when a worker is done with a ticket, assigns a new ticket immediately.
Scrum works by assigning all estimated tickets to workers to fill up a sprint log. All workers work to complete the sprint and move to the next sprint when complete.
